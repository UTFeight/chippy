# Chippy

My Notes about everything!

## Dwm (Window manager)

- Very nice UI using siduck/chadwm fastest wm I have ever seen

## Picom (X compositor)

- Everyone uses it, so I do. Here is the window manager
  [fork/branch](https://github.com/dccsillag/picom/tree/implement-window-animations)

## Neovim (That Editor)

- Using siduck/NvChad: not bloated

# Terminal

## Showkey

use following command to see what is the escape code of a shortcut:

```shell
showkey -a
```

# Disk Scanner

- dua-rs: fast & solid disk scanner written in rust
